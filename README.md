# Multithreaded Autonomous Driving Task Scheduler

This project simulates a modular, real-time task scheduler for autonomous driving (AD) using C++17 and multithreading.  
It's designed as a **portfolio-grade project** to demonstrate systems integration, real-time logic, and autonomous behavior simulation.

# Why This Project?

This project was designed to showcase:
- Systems-level thinking for real-time robotics
- Safe multithreaded programming with shared data coordination
- AD-style planning and control modules
- Real-time simulation without any hardware dependencies

---

## Overview

The simulation consists of five major modules, each running in its own thread:

| Module           | Purpose                                                                    |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Sensor Fusion`  | Simulates Lidar & Camera input and fuses them into a unified obstacle list |
| `Perception`     | Analyzes threat level based on obstacle data (distance, angle, velocity)   |
| `Planning`       | Determines safe path direction and target speed                            |
| `Control`        | Converts path decisions into throttle and steering commands                |
| `Dashboard`      | Displays real-time system state via a colorized ASCII dashboard            |

## âœ¨ Features

- âœ… Multithreaded architecture using `std::thread`, `mutex`, and `condition_variable`
- âœ… Terminal-based live dashboard with ANSI color output
- âœ… Simulated Lidar & Camera sensor data
- âœ… Sensor fusion with basic data association
- âœ… Threat classification (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH)
- âœ… Rule-based path planning
- âœ… PID-style throttle and steering generation
- âœ… CSV logging for later analysis (`control_log.csv`, `planning_log.csv`)
- âœ… Lightweight, cross-platform (runs on WSL, Linux, or native POSIX)

## Build & Run Instructions

### âœ… Prerequisites

- C++17 or later
- CMake â‰¥ 3.10
- Linux, macOS, or WSL (tested in Ubuntu WSL2)



### Build 

```bash
cd build
cmake ..
make
```



### Run

```./ad_scheduler```

Youâ€™ll see a live-updating, colorized ASCII dashboard showing the simulation in real time.



### CSV Logging

Two CSV logs are generated in the current working directory:

```control_log.csv``` â€“ throttle and steering values per cycle

```planning_log.csv``` â€“ path direction, speed, and threat level per cycle

These can be analyzed using Excel, Python, or MATLAB.
